# BONUS: now using sorted, put the jumbled sentence into this order:
# a quick brown fox jumps over the laziest dog
# this should still be a list of words, not a single string
# this is a very sneaky!

# BONUS BONUS BONUS: Back to using max! How can we get the _first_ word
# alphabetically in the list? This one is _very_ sneaky (and
# absolutely not recommended in real code. Just use min!).

# This is very challenging and requires concepts not covered in the
# curriculum! Feel no pressure to attempt this at all!
